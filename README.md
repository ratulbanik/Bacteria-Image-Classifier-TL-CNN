# Bacteria Image Classifier using Transfer Learning and CNNs 

**Please note:** The specific subset of the DIBaS dataset used, preprocessing steps, data augmentation techniques, model training details, charts, and graphs are proprietary and not publicly available. These can be accessed upon request.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying images of microorganisms using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, specifically VGG-16 and MobileNet-V2. We explore the effectiveness of transfer learning in automating the identification of bacteria species from microscopic images. 

## Motivation

This project is driven by several key goals:

* **Evaluate Transfer Learning:** Assess the performance of pre-trained CNN models (VGG-16 and MobileNet-V2) on a specialized image classification task.
* **Automate Bacteria Classification:** Develop a system that can automatically categorize bacterial species from images, potentially aiding in faster and more accurate diagnoses in medical and research settings.
* **Deepen Understanding:**  Gain hands-on experience with transfer learning, CNNs, and image classification techniques in the context of a real-world application.

## Dataset

We utilize a subset of the Digital Images of Bacteria Species (DIBaS) dataset for this project.

**Key Details of the DIBaS Dataset:**

* **Content:** Images of 33 different bacterial species, with 20 images per species.
* **Source:** Collected by the Chair of Microbiology at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland.
* **Staining Method:** All samples were stained using the Gram's method. 
* **Purpose:** Designed for classification and analysis of bacterial species, particularly for training and evaluating machine learning models.

**Project-Specific Dataset Details:**

* **Selected Classes:** We chose 10 specific bacterial species from the DIBaS dataset for this classification task. 
* **Preprocessing & Augmentation:**  We performed preprocessing and data augmentation steps on the selected images to enhance model training.  *(Details of the specific techniques used are proprietary and not included here.)*

## Models and Experiments

We trained and evaluated the following models:

* **VGG-16**
* **MobileNet-V2** 


## Instructions to Run
